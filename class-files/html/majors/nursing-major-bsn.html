</div></div></div><p class="body">Courses in the nursing major are taken at the upper-division level. The courses build on a strong foundation in the sciences and humanities to develop the knowledge and skills needed to practice nursing in contemporary society. Clinical experiences take place in a broad variety of settings that reflect current patterns of health care delivery and provide opportunities for students to develop competence in empathetic care, critical thinking, technical skills, clinical judgment and decision making, interdisciplinary collaboration, and management of care.</p>
<p class="body"><a href="/undergraduate/schools-college/nursing/">Admission</a> to the program is required.</p>
<h2 class="head2-11-pt-arial-">Program of Study</h2>
<p class="body">The School of Nursing at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill offers an undergraduate program of study designed to provide students with the knowledge, skill, and understanding necessary to function effectively in all areas of professional nursing. The curriculum leading to the bachelor of science in nursing (B.S.N.) degree offers two options for study:</p>
<ol>
	<li class="body">two years of upper-division courses in the School of Nursing, which follow two years of lower-division courses in the General College (or equivalent courses completed at another college/university) OR a previously earned bachelor’s degree plus the noted prerequisites (B.S.N. Option); and</li>
	<li class="body">an accelerated second degree option for students with a previous bachelor’s degree (A.B.S.N. Option).</li>
</ol>
<p class="body">Students are subject to the requirements in place when they are admitted to the School of Nursing; consequently, the requirements described in this catalog particularly apply to students admitted to the School of Nursing during the 2019–2020 academic year. Students admitted in prior years will follow the plans of study in the catalog year in which they were admitted to the School of Nursing.</p></div><!--end #textcontainer -->

			<div id="criticalinformationtextcontainer" class="tab_content" role="tabpanel">
				<a name="criticalinformationtext"></a><h2 class="head2-11-pt-arial-">Critical Information for ALL Nursing Students</h2>
<h3 class="heading-3-bold">Essential Standards for Admission, Progression, and Graduation</h3>
<p class="body">The curricula leading to degrees in nursing from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Nursing require students to engage in diverse and complex experiences directed at the acquisition and practice of essential nursing skills and functions. Unique combinations of cognitive, affective, psychomotor, physical, and social abilities are required to perform these functions satisfactorily. In addition to being essential to the successful completion of the requirements of a nursing degree, these skills and functions are necessary to ensure the health and safety of patients, fellow students, faculty members, and other health care providers.</p>
<p class="body">The Essential Standards document describes the nonacademic qualifications, required in addition to academic qualifications, which the school considers critical for entrance to, continuation in, and graduation from a UNC–Chapel Hill School of Nursing degree program. Candidates for nursing degrees, with the exception noted for selected graduate programs, must be able to meet these minimum standards, with or without reasonable accommodation, for successful completion of degree requirements. Refer to the school’s <a href="https://nursing.unc.edu/academic-programs/bsn/" target="_blank">Web site</a> for additional information.</p>
<h3 class="heading-3-bold">Professional Risk</h3>
<p class="body">The practice of nursing involves the care of individuals who are ill or injured. Communicable diseases are common in health care delivery settings and may be a threat to nursing students. During the performance of clinical practice/research activities, a student may have contact with patients/subjects with HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and other infections. Such contact, although rare when proper preventive measures are used, may result in a student’s being exposed to infectious agents and/or transmitting an infectious disease to other students, faculty members, patients, family members, and subjects. During pregnancy, the fetus may be at risk. Students enrolled in the School of Nursing at UNC–Chapel Hill are expected to provide care to patients who may have known or unknown communicable diseases. Application to and acceptance of an offer from the School of Nursing indicates a student’s understanding of related professional risks.</p>
<h3 class="heading-3-bold">Fitness for Practice</h3>
<p class="body">All students admitted to the School of Nursing are required by the North Carolina Board of Nursing to provide documentation of their fitness to provide safe nursing care to the public. Failure to provide requisite documentation will result in the withdrawal of the admission offer. Additionally, North Carolina law requires incoming students to present to the University, before the first day of enrollment, evidence verifying that the student has received all required immunizations.</p>
<p class="body">Further, federal and state statutory regulations and clinical affiliate contractual mandates require that nursing students demonstrate particular cognitive and clinical competencies consistent with minimum professional practice standards. Students must attain and maintain full compliance with all such requirements. The school also requires students to undergo, at the student’s expense, a 12-panel urine drug screen and a criminal history database check following admission acceptance. The check covers all addresses where the student has lived, worked, or attended an educational institution in the past seven years or since the 16th birthday, whichever is less. Database checks will address all criminal charges, felony and misdemeanor level convictions (except minor traffic related violations), and the Sexual Offender/Predator Registry for all states in which the student has lived. Reports are shared with clinical agencies that require that all charges be resolved prior to the start of clinical practice. Clinical agencies may impose additional requirements at their discretion, which must be completed at the student's expense. Questions about these requirements may be directed to the clinical contract and compliance coordinator.</p>
<h3 class="heading-3-bold">Disability Statement</h3>
<p class="body">Consistent with its mission and philosophy, the School of Nursing at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is committed to providing educational opportunities to students with disabilities. In accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the school provides reasonable accommodations to otherwise qualified students with disabilities. The decision regarding appropriate accommodations will be based on the specifics of each case.</p>
<p class="body">Students who seek reasonable accommodations for disabilities must contact the <a href="https://ars.unc.edu/" target="_blank">Office of Accessibility Resources &amp; Service</a> ([919] 962-8300). Staff in this office will determine a student’s eligibility for, and recommend, appropriate accommodations and services. Also see the <a href="https://sonportal.unc.edu/current-students/student-handbook/" target="_blank">School of Nursing’s policy</a>.</p>
<h3 class="heading-3-bold">Computer Requirements</h3>
<p class="body">All School of Nursing students are required to use e-mail for conveying course/clinical/research/other school-related business. All e-mail communication regarding School of Nursing matters must utilize the student’s University e-mail address only. The use of external e-mail services is not permitted. School of Nursing courses use the Sakai learning management system, which requires frequent reliable access to Internet resources. For both these reasons, easy access to personal computers and the Web are imperative. The School of Nursing provides a PC laboratory solely for the use of undergraduate students, and students may also access PC laboratory facilities elsewhere on campus.</p>
<p class="body">All B.S.N. and A.B.S.N. option students are required to have a laptop computer that meets the minimum requirements specified for the preloaded laptop computers available through the University’s <a href="http://cci.unc.edu/new-students/minimum-laptop-requirement" target="_blank">Carolina Computing Initiative (CCI) program</a>. Choosing a vendor for the laptop purchase is the student’s prerogative; however, it is important to note that the University provides “software and operating system support for non-CCI laptops on a best-effort basis. Hardware support for non-CCI laptops is the responsibility of the owner” (source: <a href="http://CCI.unc.edu" target="_blank">CCI.unc.edu</a>). In addition to the computer itself, students must have an internet service provider (ISP) and an account for a high-speed access service.</p>
<p class="body">Of note: the School of Nursing uses ExamSoft for testing. Students are required to purchase this program and ensure computer compatibility with the program.</p>
<h3 class="heading-3-bold">Vehicular Requirements</h3>
<p class="body">Because of the broad scope of clinical facilities and locations, undergraduate nursing students must have access to a car. For information about the North Carolina requirements for automobile liability insurance, vehicle registration, and operator’s license, write to the North Carolina Department of Motor Vehicles, Raleigh, N.C. 27602. Students and/or parents are responsible for maintaining appropriate insurance coverage. Some insurance companies may consider such travel as “business driving.” Expenses for travel are the responsibility of the student.</p>
<h3 class="heading-3-bold">Registered Nurse Licensure Examination Requirements</h3>
<p class="body">The North Carolina Board of Nursing (NCBON) requires all graduates of the School of Nursing who apply to take the National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX) to undergo a routine criminal background check, which necessitates submission of a complete set of fingerprints with the NCLEX application. A Social Security Number is required for the licensure application to the NCBON.</p>
<h3 class="body">New Student Orientation</h3>
<p class="head2-11-pt-arial-">All newly admitted B.S.N. and A.B.S.N. students are required to attend a mandatory orientation session one business day prior to the start of courses during their first semester. To determine when classes begin, view the University’s <a href="http://registrar.unc.edu/academic-calendar" target="_blank">academic calendar</a>. UNC–Chapel Hill students who are studying abroad in the spring semester prior to matriculation should ensure their study abroad program will allow them to return to Chapel Hill prior to the new student orientation.</p>

<h2 class="head2-11-pt-arial-">Special Opportunities in Nursing</h2>
<h3 class="heading-3-bold" headerid="0" name="opportunitiestext">Hillman Scholars Program in Nursing Innovation</h3>
<p class="heading-3-bold">UNC–Chapel Hill School of Nursing is one of only two schools nationally that has been awarded renewal funding for the <a href="https://nursing.unc.edu/academic-programs/bsn/hillman-scholars-program-in-nursing-innovation/" target="_blank">Hillman Scholars Program in Nursing Innovation</a> grant. The program’s primary goal is to create a new cadre of nurse scientists and leaders who will design innovative solutions for health care delivery. This highly competitive program is open to new B.S.N. and A.B.S.N. students and provides a pathway for students to earn their B.S.N. and Ph.D. in five to six years. At least four academically talented nursing students will be admitted to the program each year and receive financial and enhanced mentoring support to facilitate their progress towards the Ph.D. By completing a Ph.D. early in their career, Hillman Scholars will have a longer time to influence patient care through leadership, innovation, and research in academic and clinical settings.</p>
<h3 class="heading-3-bold" headerid="1" name="opportunitiestext">Departmental Involvement</h3>
<p class="body">Students are encouraged to participate in <a href="http://nursing.unc.edu/current-students/student-handbook/student-organizations-and-activities-general" target="_blank">student leadership opportunities</a>. These include the elected class governance system, the dean’s Student Advisory Council or course management team options, the Association of Nursing Students (the only preprofessional nursing organization available), the Student Health Action Coalition, and a variety of special interest groups.</p>
<h3 class="body" headerid="2" name="opportunitiestext">Experiential Education</h3>
<p class="body">The nursing program requires extensive direct clinical practice in a variety of acute care, chronic care, and community-based settings considered essential for the preparation of competent practitioners. Clinical contact time varies by study option and course but averages approximately 12 to 16 hours per week.</p>
<h3 class="heading-3-bold" headerid="3" name="opportunitiestext">Financial Aid</h3>
<p class="body">Students granted admission to the School of Nursing seeking the baccalaureate degree at UNC–Chapel Hill may be considered for a variety of nursing-specific scholarships and other financial aid opportunities. For assistance, contact the Office of Scholarships and Student Aid by phone at (919) 962-8396 or through the Web at <a href="http://studentaid.unc.edu" target="_blank">studentaid.unc.edu</a>, or call the Office of Students Affairs at (919) 966-4260.</p>
<h3 class="heading-3-bold" headerid="4" name="opportunitiestext">Study Abroad</h3>
<p class="body">Students are encouraged to participate in a variety of <a href="https://nursing.unc.edu/outreach/global-partnerships/">study abroad options </a>offered through required or elective courses.</p>
<h3 class="heading-3-bold" headerid="5" name="opportunitiestext">Undergraduate Awards</h3>
<p class="body">During the final semester of study, high achieving students (GPA <u>&gt;</u> 3.5) in each option will be invited to membership in Sigma Theta Tau International Nursing Honor Society. The George Livas Award recognizes the graduating student who most clearly demonstrates academic excellence and leadership. Other awards presented during the school’s commencement ceremony honor those students achieving the highest grade point average in their respective option.</p>
<h3 class="heading-3-bold" headerid="6" name="opportunitiestext">Undergraduate Research</h3>
<p class="body">Through the <a href="http://honorscarolina.unc.edu" target="_blank">honors program</a> the University and the School of Nursing recognize undergraduates who have demonstrated exceptional academic ability and independent work in their major. Qualified and interested students in their last two semesters of study will be paired with a faculty advisor who guides the student in an independent study honors project. The Assistant Dean for the undergraduate program supervises the honors program. Students participating in the honors program must have a cumulative University grade point average that meets University requirements. In addition, students must have and maintain a 3.4 cumulative nursing grade point average. Calculation of the cumulative grade point average is based solely on the required hours earned to date for the nursing degree. Grade point averages are not rounded. The student and honors advisor must complete a written contract, and the student must register for <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=NURS%20691H" title="NURS 691H" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'NURS 691H');">NURS 691H</a></span> and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=NURS%20692H" title="NURS 692H" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'NURS 692H');">NURS 692H</a></span>. Each honors course carries three hours of credit and is assigned a letter grade by the advisor. A student’s project must show evidence of independent, creative, abstract, analytical, and critical thinking.</p>
